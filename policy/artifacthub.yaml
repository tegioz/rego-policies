  # rego-policies
  [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) policies collection.

  ## Policies
  For a full list of policies, see the auto-generated [POLICIES.md](/POLICIES.md)

  The naming of the policies follows the Gatekeeper format, as described [here.](https://github.com/plexsystems/konstraint#how-template-and-constraint-naming-works)

  ## 3rd Party Policies
  A list of git repos that contain rego polices which can be combined with this repo:
  - [deprek8ion: Rego policies to monitor Kubernetes APIs deprecations](https://github.com/swade1987/deprek8ion)

  ## Tools
  ### Conftest
  conftest is a CLI to execute rego policies. It can be used to test locally before pushing to [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).
  - [https://www.conftest.dev/install](https://www.conftest.dev/install/)

  ### OPA Playground
  OPA provides a web based playground, which can highlight which lines have been activated. Having issues with your policy? check it out with "Coverage" enabled:
